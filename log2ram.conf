# Configuration file for Log2Ram (https://github.com/azlux/log2ram) under MIT license.
# This configuration file is read by the log2ram service

# Size for the ram folder, it defines the size the log folder will reserve into the RAM.
# If it's not enough, log2ram will not be able to use ram. Check you /var/log size folder.
# The default is 40M and is basically enough for a lot of applications.
# You will need to increase it if you have a server and a lot of log for example.
SIZE=40M

# This variable can be set to true if you prefer "rsync" rather than "cp".
# I use the command cp -u and rsync -X, so I don't copy the all folder every time for optimization.
# You can choose which one you want. Be sure rsync is installed if you use it.
USE_RSYNC=false

# If there are some errors with available RAM space, a system mail will be send
# Change it to false and you will have only a log if there is no place on RAM anymore.
MAIL=true

# Variable for folders to put in RAM. You need to specify the real folder `/path/folder` , the `/path/hdd.folder` will be automatically created. Multiple path can be separeted by `;`. Do not add the final `/` !
# example : PATH_DISK="/var/log;/home/test/FolderInRam"
PATH_DISK="/var/log"

# This setting determines whether log2ram will ever write /var/log back to the disk, whether at shutdown or periodically (depending on whether you keep
# the file in cron.daily). Setting this to 'false' will mean that log2ram will never write its copy of /var/log back to the disk.

WRITE_TO_DISK=true

# **************** Zram backing conf  *************************************************

# ZL2R Zram Log 2 Ram enables a zram drive when ZL2R=true ZL2R=false is mem only tmpfs
ZL2R=false
# COMP_ALG this is any compression algorithm listed in /proc/crypto
# lz4 is fastest with lightest load but deflate (zlib) and Zstandard (zstd) give far better compression ratios
# lzo is very close to lz4 and may with some binaries have better optimisation
# COMP_ALG=lz4 for speed or Zstd for compression, lzo or zlib if optimisation or availabilty is a problem
COMP_ALG=lz4
# LOG_DISK_SIZE is the uncompressed disk size. Note zram uses about 0.1% of the size of the disk when not in use
# LOG_DISK_SIZE is expected compression ratio of alg chosen multiplied by log SIZE
# lzo/lz4=2.1:1 compression ratio zlib=2.7:1 zstandard=2.9:1
# Really a guestimate of a bit bigger than compression ratio whilst minimising 0.1% mem usage of disk size
LOG_DISK_SIZE=100M
