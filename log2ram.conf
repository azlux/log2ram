# Configuration file for Log2Ram (https://github.com/azlux/log2ram) under MIT license.
# This configuration file is read by the log2ram service

# Size for the ram folder, it defines how much space is reserved in the RAM for the logs.
# Ensure 'SIZE=' is larger than your /var/log directory.
#  - (If not enough is reserved, log2ram will fail to start).
# Ensure logrotate is set to keep your /var/log directory from growing too large.
#  - (If your /var/log directory grows larger than 'SIZE=', new logs entries can't be written).
# The default of 128M is adequate for a lot of applications.
# You will need to increase it if you have a server and a lot of log for example.
SIZE=128M

# Select the log syncing method between disk and RAM:
# - 'rsync' is the default unless 'USE_RSYNC' is set to 'false'.
# - If 'rsync' is unavailable, 'cp' is automatically used as a fallback.
# - Set 'USE_RSYNC' to 'false' to explicitly use 'cp'.
#USE_RSYNC=false

# By default, if there is insufficient RAM space, a system notification email is sent.
# Set this to 'false' to disable email notifications. (The error will still be logged locally).
#NOTIFICATION=true

# Specify the command for sending error notifications.
# By default, it uses the `mail` command to send an email, with the message body provided via stdin.
# You can replace this with any command (such as 'shoutrrr') or a custom script for handling notifications.
#NOTIFICATION_COMMAND=mail -s "Log2Ram Error on $HOSTNAME"

# Specify the directories to be stored in RAM. List each directory using its absolute path, e.g., `/path/folder`.
# Corresponding directories on the HDD, named `/path/hdd.folder`, will be automatically created for each listed path.
# Separate multiple paths with a semicolon `;` and do not include a trailing slash at the end of the paths.
# Example: PATH_DISK="/var/log;/home/test/FolderInRam"
PATH_DISK="/var/log"

# Should log2ram consider journald and do a log rotate before copying the log files back? Please note that for this
# rsync is mandatory. Also make sure that you have configured SystemMaxUse in journald.conf, because the size of this
# ram folder is will probably not be as large as journald will use by default
JOURNALD_AWARE=true

# Set to 'true' to enable log rotation for journald logs before syncing. 
# Note: 'rsync' must be used for this feature. 
# Ensure 'SystemMaxUse' is configured in 'journald.conf' 
#  - (To limit journaldâ€™s disk usage to be smaller than the log2ram RAM allocation).
JOURNALD_AWARE=true


# **************** Zram backing conf  *************************************************

# ZL2R Zram Log 2 Ram enables a zram drive when ZL2R=true ZL2R=false is mem only tmpfs
ZL2R=false
# COMP_ALG this is any compression algorithm listed in /proc/crypto
# lz4 is fastest with lightest load but deflate (zlib) and Zstandard (zstd) give far better compression ratios
# lzo is very close to lz4 and may with some binaries have better optimisation
# COMP_ALG=lz4 for speed or Zstd for compression, lzo or zlib if optimisation or availabilty is a problem
COMP_ALG=lz4
# LOG_DISK_SIZE is the uncompressed disk size. Note zram uses about 0.1% of the size of the disk when not in use
# LOG_DISK_SIZE is expected compression ratio of alg chosen multiplied by log SIZE
# lzo/lz4=2.1:1 compression ratio zlib=2.7:1 zstandard=2.9:1
# Really a guestimate of a bit bigger than compression ratio whilst minimising 0.1% mem usage of disk size
LOG_DISK_SIZE=256M
